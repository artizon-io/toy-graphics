# Computer Graphics Basics

## Convention
- Left-handed / Right-handed system
- Row-major / Colume-major ordering (matrices)
- Normalised coordinates: 0 to 1 / -1 to 1
- Look at -ve z / +ve z / y

## Graphics Pipeline
1. Per-vertex operation (vertex shader). Optional tessellation & geometric shader
2. Projection + clipping
3. Rasterisation (non-programmable ; fixed) on each generated primitive. Write each pixels' color to colorbuffer (framebuffer)
4. Per-fragment (pixel + some data from other buffers e.g. z, stencil) operation (fragment shader). Optional blending
5. Double buffering: swap front buffer with back buffer and have monitor loads from the front buffer

## Geometry Pipeline
1. Load models into world: model coord -> world coord (Model transform)
2. Specify camera and view volume (or clipping window if 2D) in world coord
3. View transform: world coord -> viewing coord (with respect to camera) (View transform)
4. Viewing coord -> normalised viewing coord (view volume -> cube if 3D)
5. (3D only) Projection
6. Clipping
7. Window-viewport transformation: normalised viewing coord -> normalised device coord

## View Volume
- Perspective: frustum (paramid without tip) ; specify using fov, near plane, far plane
- Orthogonal: box/cube ; used also for 2D

# C++

## Dynamic Library
- `*dll.lib` contains function pointers to the functions in `.dll` (`.dylib` if *nix). Eliminate need to query the functions locations at runtime (by invoking a dynamic loader)
- Place `.dll` at same directory as `.exe` to have `.dll` be loaded at launch time
- Dynamic lib lives in the same process and address space (global, heap, stack, code) hence global and heap are shared
- A dynamic loader process is started by the kernel at launch time and the loader will attempt to find all dependent libraries in the filesystem. Abort if cannot find all. The dynamic loader also loads dynamic lib at runtime at the app's request (on-request).
- Different platform implement dynamic loader differently. *nix uses DLC (dynamic loader compatibility) functions
  - `dlopen`: "Open" the lib. Load dynamic lib into current process's address space (if not already exist). Return dynamic lib handle. Increment ref count (no. times current process has invoked `dlopen` on the dynamic lib)
  - `dlsys`: Return the address of the requested symbol exported by the dynamic lib
  - `dlcount`: Decrement ref count. If ref count reaches 0, unload lib from current process's address space
- ABI (app binary interface) all the symbols exposed to clients
- API (app programming interface) functions that a library makes available to its clients
- Must disclose the libraryâ€™s major version number in its filename if intended to have future revisions
- Break the ABI/API = major version
- Compiler `-current_version` option to set the minor version
- Compiler `-compatibility_version` option to set the earliest minor version of the dynamic lib that the `.exe` is compatible with. At load time, the compatibility version is compared against the minor version of the dynamic lib situated in the file system. Abort if not compatible (< compatibility version)

### Symbol Exporting Strategies
- Prefix private symbols with `_`
1. `static`: drawback: hide private symbols from other modules in the dynamic lib
2. `export_list` file: list all the public symbols (with an `_` prefix)

```
# File: export_list
_name
_set_name
```

```bash
clang -dynamiclib Person.c -exported_symbols_list export_list -o libPerson.dylib
```

3. Combination of visibility attribute and compiler `-fvisibility` option (specifies the visibility of symbols with unspecified visibility)

```c++
/* File: Person.c */

// Symbolic name for visibility("default") attribute.
#define EXPORT __attribute__((visibility("default")))

EXPORT                        // Symbol to export
char* name(void) {
    return _person_name;
}
 
void _set_name(char* name) {
   strcpy(_person_name, name);
}
```

```bash
% clang -dynamiclib Person.c -fvisibility=hidden -o libPerson.dylib
```
